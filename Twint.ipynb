The people don't want this. They want help. They want to pay their bills &amp; feed their families. This is partisanship at work &amp; the American people are paying the price.\n",

      "1319646952146014209 2020-10-23 08:28:45 -0600 <SenatorBennet> I‚Äôve heard over and over from Coloradans about the toll this crisis has taken on their mental health. Our bipartisan bill will triple funding for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, ensuring those who are seeking help have an easier time finding it.  https://t.co/9lXtg30CqL\n",
      "1319318409553858560 2020-10-22 10:43:15 -0600 <SenatorBennet> Our thoughts are with the evacuees of the #EastTroublesomeFire &amp; other #wildfires burning across Colorado.   We're in touch with local authorities &amp; working to ensure our firefighters &amp; first responders have the federal resources they need to combat these fires.   More info‚¨áÔ∏è\n",
      "1319085936639135744 2020-10-21 19:19:29 -0600 <SenatorBennet> My colleagues &amp; I are asking @HHSgov &amp; @USTreasury to analyze what the impact on health coverage would be if the ACA is overturned. Experts estimate over 20M Americans' health care is at risk‚Äì‚Äìbut that number could be even higher because of #COVID19. More:  https://t.co/0Hs3X0YVxe\n",
      "1319001813924892675 2020-10-21 13:45:12 -0600 <SenatorBennet> McConnell asked Senate Democrats in 2014 to \"put the ideology and political show votes aside and give the American people what they‚Äôve been asking for...\"  He should heed his own advice‚Äîstop the political stunts and pass a bipartisan relief package now.  https://t.co/6Hm7ifDucR\n",
      "1319000466072735750 2020-10-21 13:39:51 -0600 <SenatorBennet> This is heart-wrenching and it never should have happened. We need to figure out a way to reunite these children with their families.  https://t.co/dFxUgIKgYJ\n",
      "1318965907008487424 2020-10-21 11:22:32 -0600 <SenatorBennet> If the #ACA is overturned, @urbaninstitute estimates that CO will lose nearly $3B in federal investments in health care. We should be increasing funding for health care, not taking it away‚Äì‚Äìespecially during a global pandemic.    This is #WhatsAtStake with this SCOTUS nomination.\n",
      "1318678366430597122 2020-10-20 16:19:57 -0600 <SenatorBennet> Mitch McConnell's PPP stunt is woefully inadequate.  He should stop the politics &amp; work in good faith w/ Democrats &amp; the administration to pass a comprehensive relief package that will actually support the American people.
