                <h3 style="color:Purple; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', monospace;"><b>Our Question</b></h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'monospace', monospace;">
                    &emsp;&emsp;How much misinformation was created or shared by Colorado’s elected officials during the 2020 Presidential Election?
                </p>
                <h3 style="color:Purple; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', monospace;"><b>Background and Motivation</b></h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'monospace', monospace;">
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In this day and age, where social media seems to be a large part of many of our lives, we want to investigate how the rise of platforms has affected the type of information we encounter. Before social media became a news feed to many millions of Americans, we looked to news outlets, journalists, organizations, and our government for correct information on issues. In this new platform centered climate, information is coming from all corners of the internet. This has begun a rise in factually incorrect information, or misinformation. Recent examples of this are shown in the spread of misinformation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election. This recent increase in misinformation has motivated our interest in figuring out where and why misinformation is spreading so rapidly. And we will be taking a closer look at misinformation about the 2020 Presidential Election.  <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Misinformation has always been around as a counter to real information. We see misinformation perpetuated in our society in the form of conspiracy theories. The motivation for this project is based on the surge in misinformation surrounding the 2020 election, that was heightened by a pandemic that stirred more political emotions. For example, “Misinformation on COVID-19 is so pervasive that even some patients dying from the disease still say it’s a hoax. In March 2020, nearly 30% of U.S. adults believed the Chinese government created the Coronavirus as a bioweapon and in June, a quarter believed the outbreak was intentionally planned by people in power” (Abrams, 2020). The doubt by some in the pandemic introduced a climate where misinformation started becoming more mainstream. We see the devastating nature of misinformation when we look at the recent events at the United States Capitol on January 6th. Hundreds of people stormed the Capitol building thinking they had the power to overturn the 2020 presidential election, based on a lie. Both of these events have caused great damage to our fellow citizens, health, news, and political institutions. We want to investigate why people do not believe what is in front of them. How did we create a climate where we doubt our original sources of information? Are there certain groups that believe in misinformation more than others? These are just some of the questions we want to address in this project as we try to figure out how and why misinformation spreads so much in politics. <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Because misinformation has become such a political issue, we will look at how much misinformation is pushed/published/shared by our elected officials. In order to do this, we will have to look through a series of tweets posted by our representatives. We will decide on a timeline to scrape the posts and we will essentially become fact checkers. This will help us figure out how much of what our representatives post is misleading or blatantly false. <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;By doing this type of research, we will be able to figure out which representatives are sharing the most misinformation. We want constituents to know what their elected officials are saying about certain issues. We want voters to make decisions about their representatives based on the truth and clarity of their messages. Elected officials are supposed to reassure the public with trustworthy information. This has not been the case recently and we want to make sure that those in power and access to information are correctly informing the masses.
